# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Exploratory data analysis in R.
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. 
A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.
We will be using a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for the city of Chicago in the U.S.
